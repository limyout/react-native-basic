**useEffect**
* It is useEffect that allows the functions to be used at once when componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount is active.
* UseEffect runs after the Dom is updated or the state is changed.

**Dom?** ; Document Object Model
<br>

* Web browsers use DOM to apply javascript and CSS to objects.

**Hooks rule?

1. It must be written at the top of the react function.
- Do not use within conditional statements, internal functions, or repeating statements.

2. Use only within the react function.
